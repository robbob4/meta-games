Todo:

Backlog:
- particle effect for construction
- hover for patron info: Happiness, money, destination, interests (patron/new ui element)
- Optimize find scripts by having global game manager maintain them, and distribute them - and ensure they are static wherever possible - see soundEffects array in GlobalGameManager (game manager)
- Delay quit action when in game?
- more status messages? (room/patron)
- randomize patron name
- randomize shop name
- more room art (room)
- shortest path graph
